## Differences:

- This project can track each user's interest and it already matches if the one provider has that one piece.
- Centralized Order Management: Users can manage and track all their orders from a single interface, integrating both order details and order items seamlessly.
- Real-time Inventory Check: The system updates in real-time to reflect the current inventory status of providers, ensuring that users see the most accurate availability information.
